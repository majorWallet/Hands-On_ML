    "**Neurons** consist of a cell body and complex components containing a **nucleus**. There is a branch-shaped projection called **dendrite** and a very long projection called **axon**. **Axons** can be several to 40,000 times longer than cell bodies. The ends of the **axon** are divided into **telodendria**, which are microscopic structures called synaptic terminals and are connected to **dendrites** or cell bodies of other neurons. Biological neurons create short electrical impulses called action potentials or simply signals. This signal travels along the **axon**, causing the synapse to generate a chemical signal called **neurotransmitter**. **Neurons** generate their own signals when they receive a sufficient amount of **neurotransmitter** for a few thousand of a second.\n",
